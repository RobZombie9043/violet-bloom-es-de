## VIOLET BLOOM. ES-DE Theme

A port of the [Violet Bloom](https://github.com/Midifreakz/violet-bloom) theme by [Midifreakz](https://github.com/Midifreakz) for ES-DE.

The Violet Bloom theme is a powerfull combination out of elements of the Epic Noir theme and the CRT theme. Heavily graphically redesigned.
Together creating a truely modern and aestheticly pleasing experience across Emulation Station. Heavily focused on console, controller and logo nostalgia.
